To the extent that anything connects Rowling to Tartt, and to the current craze for Knausgaard, Ferrante and the rest, I think it is that feeling, something Iâ€™ve noticed friends mention while reading the Ferrante, amazed at the spell she casts: a desire to return to those "primal and innocent delights" [quoted from James Wood], not just of childish reading, but of reading. All of these writers have in common readers who offer their loyalty the way any reader does after finding a novel they want to enter and never leave.
